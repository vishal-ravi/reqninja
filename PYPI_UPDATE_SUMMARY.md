# ReqNinja v1.2.0 - PyPI Update Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Package Ready for PyPI Publication

### What Was Fixed
Your original issue: **`reqninja https GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1` was not working**

**Root Cause:** CLI expected `http` command (not `https`) and lowercase methods (`get` not `GET`)

### Solution Implemented
1. **Enhanced CLI Error Handling:**
   - Added `https` command that provides helpful guidance
   - Enhanced `http` command to catch uppercase methods
   - Clear, actionable error messages guide users to correct syntax

2. **Package Updates:**
   - Version updated to 1.2.0
   - Built wheel and source distribution
   - Locally tested and verified functionality

### CLI Improvements Demonstrated

**Before (v1.1.0):**
```bash
$ reqninja https GET https://example.com
# Confusing error: "No such command 'https'"
```

**After (v1.2.0):**
```bash
$ reqninja https GET https://example.com
‚ùå Use 'reqninja http' for both HTTP and HTTPS requests.
üìù Examples:
  reqninja http get https://api.example.com/data
  reqninja http post http://localhost:3000/api/users
üí° Try: reqninja http get https://example.com

$ reqninja http GET https://example.com  
‚ùå Use lowercase: 'reqninja http get'
üìù Example: reqninja http get <url>
